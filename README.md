### How to connect with mongodb database

For this project, I used local mongodb. Before running the app you must have the mongodb running. You have to install mongodb on your local machine if you don't want to change the mongodb config. I didn't setup any password for mongodb. after installing mongodb run the local server by running `mongod`. you can explore the database form MongoDB Compass or with `mongo` from shell.

# How to run

**Backend**: open the backend folder from your project directory in terminal. Then run `yarn dev`. Note: if you want to run with only npm, try deleting the `yarn-lock.json` file and then run `npm run dev`.

**Frontend**: open the frontend folder form your project diretory in terminal. Then run `yarn start`.
